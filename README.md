### Install

```coffeescript
npm install caffeine-script-compatibility-test
```

### Background

CaffeineScript uses a subset of ES6's capabilities. This tool lets you see if a browser would be fully supported without transpiling with a tool like Babel. Of course you can always use Babel to get compatility on older browers.
